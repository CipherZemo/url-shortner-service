# URL Shortener Service

**This project is an advanced, full-stack URL Shortener service, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It goes beyond a basic tool by incorporating a complete user authentication system and a personal dashboard. The core functionality allows any visitor to submit a long URL and receive a shortened, unique link. When this short link is used, the service redirects the user to the original destination while invisibly tracking the number of clicks.**

**Key Enhancements:** The project includes a user registration and login system. Authenticated users get access to a private dashboard where they can view a history of all the links they've created, along with their corresponding short URLs and real-time click counts. This transforms the project from a simple utility into a portfolio-ready, multi-user web application, demonstrating your ability to handle data relationships, build protected APIs, and manage user state in a full-stack environment. The final application will be robust, scalable, and feature-rich, laying the groundwork for a potential future business.
